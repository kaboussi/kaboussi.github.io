# About:
I'm Redouane Elkaboussi, a software engineer student specializing in backend development and API design. With a focus on delivering high-quality code, I strive for the lowest time complexity and optimal speed in my projects. I have a deep understanding of various programming languages, tools, and technologies from the lowest level like the C/C++ programming laguage to the highest level like python/Javascript, and I excel in building scalable backend systems and crafting well-structured APIs.

Linux is my preferred operating system, and I am adept at leveraging its power for development. Navigating the command line interface and configuring environments come naturally to me. I strongly believe in the importance of clean, maintainable code and follow industry best practices such as modular design, code reusability, and test-driven development.
